# Meditation App Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Selected Approach**: Design System Approach with Zen Minimalism
Drawing inspiration from established meditation apps like Simple Meditation Timer and zen design principles, prioritizing distraction-free functionality over visual complexity.

**Key Design Principles**:
- Radical simplicity: Remove all non-essential elements
- Zen aesthetics: Natural, calming, and unobtrusive
- Functional clarity: Every element serves the meditation practice
- Fade-to-black: Interface disappears during sessions

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors**:
- Light Mode: Soft warm grays (200 20% 95%, 200 15% 85%)
- Dark Mode: Deep charcoals (200 15% 12%, 200 10% 8%)
- Timer accent: Gentle earth tone (25 25% 65%)

**Background Treatment**:
- Subtle gradients from light gray to white (light mode)
- Deep charcoal to black gradient (dark mode)
- Interface fades to solid black during active sessions

### B. Typography
**Font Family**: System fonts only (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI")
**Hierarchy**:
- Timer display: 4xl-6xl, thin weight (100-200)
- Section headers: xl, medium weight (500)
- Body text: base, normal weight (400)
- Minimal text usage throughout

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Primitives**: Tailwind units of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 only
- Tight spacing: p-2, m-4 for buttons and small elements
- Medium spacing: p-8, gap-8 for component separation
- Large spacing: p-16 for major sections and breathing room

### D. Component Library

**Core Timer Display**:
- Circular progress ring with subtle animation
- Large central time display with fade-in/fade-out transitions
- Minimal control buttons (play/pause/stop) with icon-only design

**Preset Selection**:
- Card-based layout with technique names and brief descriptions
- Duration badges (5min, 10min, custom)
- Instant preview of breathing patterns

**Settings Panel**:
- Minimal toggles for interval bells, visual cues, and sound preferences
- Collapsible sections to maintain clean interface
- Dark/light mode toggle

**Navigation**:
- Tab-based navigation at bottom for mobile
- Sidebar navigation for desktop
- Maximum 4 primary sections: Timer, Presets, Progress, Settings

### E. Meditation-Specific Features

**Visual Breathing Guide**:
- Expanding/contracting circle for breathing rhythm
- Subtle color transitions during breath phases
- Option to disable for pure minimalism

**Session Interface**:
- Timer fades to background during practice
- Gentle pulse animation for interval bells
- Completion celebration with soft glow effect

**Progress Tracking**:
- Simple streak counter and total minutes
- Minimal charts showing weekly/monthly practice
- Achievement badges for consistency milestones

## Essential UI Patterns

**Distraction-Free Mode**:
- Interface automatically dims after 10 seconds during sessions
- Single tap to reveal controls briefly
- Black screen option for eyes-closed practices

**Gentle Interactions**:
- All animations use ease-in-out timing
- No sudden movements or jarring transitions
- Haptic feedback on iOS for breathing cues

**Audio Integration**:
- Selection of natural bell sounds (Tibetan bowl, temple bell)
- Silent mode with visual-only cues
- Volume controls integrated into main interface

## Content Strategy
- Technique descriptions limited to 1-2 sentences
- Focus on duration and benefit rather than detailed instructions
- Progressive disclosure: advanced options hidden until needed
- No marketing copy or promotional content within the app interface

This design emphasizes the zen principle that the best interface is no interface - gradually fading away to support the user's meditation practice while maintaining essential functionality when needed.
